The following algorithm is written assuming the bot moves straight enough.

follow the path using pid control;
if all sensors to the left or all sensors to the right are white or all sensors are then stop:
	(assuming the bot has moved certain distance before stopping,)check if the current sensor values detect a straight path ahead or no path:
	if path is detected then there must be three paths:
	choose one;
	else if no path is detected then there must be two paths:
	choose one;
